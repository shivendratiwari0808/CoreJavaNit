Programming Questions:
1.Write a program to print the names of students by creating a Student
class. If no name is passed while creating an object of Student class, 
then the name should be "Unknown", otherwise the name should be equal 
to the String value passed while creating object of Student class.
Demonstrate constructor overloading for the above situation.



3.Create a class Library to represent a library. 
Implement constructor overloading to initialize the library object
with different sets of parameters, such as only libraryName, or libraryName
and location. Provide methods to add books to the library, lend books 
to members, and display all the details such as name of library,
location,no. of books,no. of books lend to people,remaining books in library.

4.Create a class Student with
Data members: name, rollNumber, department, and semester.
Implement constructor overloading to initialize the object with
different combinations of parameters, such as only name and rollNumber, 
or name, rollNumber, and department.

combinations of parameters, such as only courseCode and courseName, or 
courseCode, courseName, and department.
Provide methods to calculate the total credits of a department and
display course information.

6.Create a class Employee with 
Data Members: name, employeeId, designation, and salary.

void Accept():    to accept the values of a and b.
void Max():    to find greater of the two number 'a' and 'b' 
                 and store the result in c. Display the result.
void Min():    to find smaller of the two number 'a' and 'b' and store 
               the result in c. Display the result.
void Diff():    to store the difference between 'a' and 'b' and store the 
               result in c. Display the result.

methods.

8.Create a class Course with attributes courseCode, courseName,
department, and credits. Implement constructor overloading to initialize 
the object with different combinations of parameters, such as only 
courseCode and courseName, or courseCode, courseName, and department.
