--------------
Design sports Model system

Create  a class name Sports (BLC Class)

Attributes :
name             Return Type
-------            --------------
sportName            :String
teamSize         :int
sportType            :String

Access modifier  :private (for all variable)

Take a no parameterize constructor and initialize all the default values to variables.
Take one more constructor with two parameters sportName and teamSize and initialize with user values based on validation.
Take another constructor with 3 parameters and initialize all the values based on proper validation.

Methods  :
Method Name       : displayInfo
Return Type       : void
Acess Modifier    : public

and in this method to print all the details of the class.


Take a Main Class(ELC Class) which having main method and instantiate the object and execute the method.

Test Cases:
-------------

for teamSize, If teamSize is less than or equal to zero, it sets teamSize to 0 and prints an error message.

Test Case 1: Valid sport with name and team size
Sport Name: Football
Team Size: 11
Sport Type: Unknown

Expected Output :
---------------------
(print the details)

Test Case 2: Invalid sport with negative team size
Error: Team size must be positive.
Sport Name: Volleyball
Team Size: -1
Sport Type: Unknown

Expected Output :
---------------------
Error: Team size must be positive.

Question -3
---------------
A class called  Time is given to you. The task is to create and return a new time object in terms of hours, minutes and seconds by adding two Time objects.

Define the following for the class.

Attributes :

name
-------
hours ,minutes ,seconds as private  :-for all (int) is data type and (private) is the access modifier.

Constructor :
default : Create a no-parameterize constructor. Initialize all attributes to 0.
parametrized : Create a public parameterized constructor for hours, minutes and seconds in the same sequence.

Methods :

    Name of the method : show()
    Return Type        : void
    Modifier       : public
    Task            : It must display the time in hours: minutes: seconds format.

       Name Of the method : add(Time t1, Time t2)
    Return Type     : Time
    Modifiers:    : public, static
    Arguments    : 2 Time class as arguments.
    Task        : Add the time And displays the added times.


Take a ELC Class TimeTester class having main method instatiate the object and check the test cases.


Example :

Sample Input :
time 1 : 2:30:40
time 2 : 4:40:21

Expected output :
Result : 7:11:1


Question -4 [Copy Constructor]
------------------------------
Take a class Student(BLC Class)

Attributes:
 
names        dataType
---------      -----------
studentId         :  int
studentName       : String
studentAge        : int

Access Modifier :private for all variables

take one no-parameterize constructor and initialize with default value.

Take one parameterize constructor to initialize all the attributes.

develop getter and setter method to access the private properties



Methods:
Name Of the method     : showDetails()  
    Return Type         : void
    Modifiers:        : public
This method should print all the details of the Student.


Take one more (BLC Class) Player .

Attributes:

names        dataType
---------    -----------
playerId      int
playerName    String
playerAge     int

Access Modifier :private for all variables


create a Copy constructor that takes a Student object as argument and initializes the Player object's attributes using the Student object's attributes.

Methods :

Name Of the method     : showDetails()  
    Return Type         : void
    Modifiers:        : public


Name Of the method     : updateName(String newName)

    Return Type     : void
    Modifiers:        : public
Public method to update the player's name.


Name Of the method     : isEligible()  
    Return Type     : void
    Modifiers:    : boolean
method that returns a boolean indicating if the player is eligible (e.g., age must be at least 18).


Take one Main class(ELC Class) which is having main method  and instantiate the both class object and
update the name of the player and print all the student and player details.
